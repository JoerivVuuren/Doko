# Doko

We are a group of seven students from the University of Amsterdam. In the month of June we have been working on a project named Doko. Doko is a interactive and fun way to keep record of your debts between housemates and friends.
You can register as a new user and invite your friends to play a game (tic tac toe) for a small amount of money. This way you'll never have to ask your friends for small amounts of money any longer, but you can just play with your debt, untill there is no more debt or the debt has gone to high and you want to payout.

This project was made by:

- Artin Sanaye
- Joeri van Vuuren
- David Smelt
- Mateusz Sadowski
- Shahrukh Zaidi
- Matthijs Bes
- Navid Ghorbanzadeh
