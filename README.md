# Doko

We are a group of seven students from the University of Amsterdam. In the month of June we have been working on a project named Doko. Doko is a interactive and fun way to keep record of your debts between housemates and friends.
You can register as a new user and invite your friends to play a game (tic tac toe) for a small amount of money. This way you don't need to ask your friends for a small amount of money but you can just play with it and make him pay more or let him win the debt.

This project was made by:

- Artin Sanaye
- Joeri van Vuuren
- David Smelt
- Mateusz Sadowski
- Shahrukh Zaidi
- Matthijs Bes
- Navid Ghorbanzadeh
