# Doko

We are a group of seven BSc Computer Science students from the University of Amsterdam. In June 2015 we have been working on our Android 5.1 app named Doko for the course Project Software Engineering. Doko is a interactive and fun way to keep record of your debts between housemates and friends.
You can register as a new user and invite your friends to play a game (Tic Tac Toe) for a small amount of money. This way you'll never have to ask your friends for small amounts of money any longer, but you can just play with your debt, until there is no more debt or the debt has gone too high and you want to payout.

To install, make sure you are on the Desktop site of Github, click "Doko.apk" and then click "view the full file", or build our source using Android Studio.

To host Doko on your own server, you should:
- import Doko.sql into your MySQL server
- place all PHP files from "_SERVER_PHP_FILES" on your server
- edit config.inc.php to specify your MySQL server parameters
- replace all references in our source code (JAVA files) of "http://intotheblu.nl/*.php" to your own server's URL
